# CyFir Rebranding Phase 2 Status Report

## Date: 2025-08-23

## Executive Summary
Phase 2A and 2B-1 have been successfully completed with all tests passing. The rebranding is proceeding safely with full backward compatibility maintained.

## Completed Work

### Phase 2A: Environment Variable Compatibility ✅
- Added support for CYFIR_* environment variables
- Maintained full backward compatibility with VELOCIRAPTOR_* variables
- CYFIR variables take precedence when both are set
- **Result**: Zero breakage for existing deployments

### Phase 2B-1: Safe String Updates ✅
- Updated setup/configuration generator messages
- Updated code comments (no runtime impact)
- Updated accessor descriptions
- **Total files changed**: 5 files with minimal, safe changes

## Test Results

### Automated Tests: 11/11 PASSED ✅
- Binary compatibility tests: PASSED
- Environment variable tests: PASSED
- String update verification: PASSED
- Compilation tests: PASSED
- Basic functionality tests: PASSED

### Manual Verification
- Code compiles without warnings
- Both binaries (velociraptor/cyfir) work identically
- No performance impact observed
- No functionality broken

## Current State

### What's Changed:
1. Config loaders support both old and new env vars
2. Setup messages show "CyFir" 
3. Some comments and descriptions updated
4. Binary identifies as "cyfir" (from earlier changes)

### What's NOT Changed (Safe):
- ✅ Service names
- ✅ Protocol identifiers
- ✅ Data formats
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Certificate fields
- ✅ Database schemas

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level: VERY LOW**
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes made
- Easy rollback available via git tags

## Rollback Points
1. `phase2b1-complete` - Current state
2. `phase2a-complete` - Before string changes
3. `checkpoint-env-compat` - Before Phase 2

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Safe):
1. Deploy to test environment for extended testing
2. Monitor for any unexpected behavior
3. Gather user feedback on visible changes

### Next Phase (Phase 2B-2) - After Testing:
1. Update more user-facing strings
2. Update log messages (verify not parsed first)
3. Update GUI text (with careful testing)

### Future Phases (Requires Planning):
1. Service name updates (needs migration plan)
2. Certificate updates (needs careful coordination)
3. Full documentation update

## Commands for Next Steps

### To continue testing:
```bash
# Run extended tests
./run_phase2_tests.sh

# Test with real config
./cyfir config generate > test.config.yaml
./cyfir --config test.config.yaml frontend -v
```

### To rollback if needed:
```bash
git reset --hard phase2a-complete
go build -tags "server_vql" -o cyfir ./bin/
```

### To proceed to Phase 2B-2:
```bash
# Only after thorough testing!
git checkout -b phase2b2-string-updates
# Continue with more string updates
```

## Sign-off
- [x] Code changes reviewed
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] No regressions identified
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Extended testing in isolated environment (recommended)
- [ ] Ready for Phase 2B-2 (pending extended tests)
