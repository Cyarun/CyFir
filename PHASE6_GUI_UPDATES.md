# Phase 6: GUI Text and Labels Update

## Overview
Searched for remaining Velociraptor references in the GUI React components.

## Updates Made

### 1. Theme Names in user-label.jsx
- ✅ Changed "Velociraptor (light)" to "CyFir (light)"
- ✅ Changed "Velociraptor (dark)" to "CyFir (dark)"
- ✅ Changed "Velociraptor Classic (light)" to "CyFir Classic (light)"

### 2. Logoff Page Messages
- ✅ Changed "Velociraptor Login" to "CyFir Login" in logoff.jsx
- ✅ Changed "Thank you for using Velociraptor... Digging Deeper!" to "Thank you for using CyFir... Digging Deeper!"

### 3. Translation Updates
- ✅ Added "Velociraptor Binary": "CyFir Binary" translation to en.jsx

## Strings NOT Changed (Compatibility Required)

### 1. Tool Names in offline-collector.jsx
```javascript
Windows: "VelociraptorWindows",
Windows_x86: "VelociraptorWindows_x86", 
Linux: "VelociraptorLinux",
MacOS: "VelociraptorCollector",
MacOSArm: "VelociraptorCollector",
Generic: "VelociraptorCollector",
```
These are internal tool identifiers that must match server artifacts.

### 2. System User Names
- "VelociraptorServer" in users.jsx - This is a system user identifier

## Translation System
The GUI uses a comprehensive translation system where most strings are already properly translated:
- "Velociraptor Login" → "CyFir Login" (already in en.jsx)
- Most UI strings reference CyFir through the translation system

## Summary
- **5 additional GUI strings updated**
- The GUI is now fully rebranded for user-visible text
- Only internal identifiers remain unchanged for compatibility
