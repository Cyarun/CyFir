# GitHub Migration Notes

## Branch Migration: master → main ✅

Successfully migrated from `master` to `main` branch:

- ✅ Created local `main` branch with all commits
- ✅ Force-pushed to GitHub `origin/main`  
- ✅ Updated local HEAD reference to point to main

## Next Steps Required on GitHub Web UI:

1. **Set Default Branch**:
   - Go to https://github.com/Cyarun/CyFir/settings/branches
   - Change default branch from `master` to `main`
   - Click "Update" and confirm

2. **Optional: Delete master branch**:
   - After confirming main is working
   - Can delete the old `master` branch

## Large File Warning ⚠️

GitHub detected several large files (89MB each):
- `cyfir` binary
- Various test binaries

**Recommendations**:
1. **Add to .gitignore** (for future):
   ```bash
   echo "output/" >> .gitignore
   echo "*_binary_*" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Consider Git LFS** for large binaries:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.exe"
   git lfs track "output/*"
   ```

3. **Clean up existing large files** (optional):
   ```bash
   git rm --cached output/cyfir
   git rm --cached test_binary_*
   git commit -m "Remove large binaries from repository"
   ```

## Current Status:
- ✅ All CyFir rebranding changes are on `main` branch
- ✅ Repository uses modern `main` default branch
- ⚠️ Large files present but functional
- 🔄 Manual GitHub UI step required for default branch

The repository is ready for use with the new `main` branch!
