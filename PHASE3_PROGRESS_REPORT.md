# Phase 3 Progress Report - Branding Configuration Integration

## Work Attempted

### 1. Added Branding Field to Config Proto ✅
- Added `use_legacy_branding` field to config.proto
- Field number 54 (next available)
- Includes semantic description

### 2. Updated Branding Configuration ✅
- Modified `GetBranding()` to accept config object
- Uses config to determine legacy mode
- Clean implementation ready

### 3. Created Legacy Detection System ✅
- `legacy_detection.go` - main detection logic
- `legacy_detection_windows.go` - Windows-specific checks
- `legacy_detection_unix.go` - non-Windows stub
- Checks for:
  - Service registrations
  - Registry keys (Windows)
  - Installation paths
  - Writeback files

## Blocker Encountered

### Protobuf Generation Issue
- Modified config.proto but protobuf code not regenerated
- Need proper protoc command with import paths
- Missing dependencies for protobuf generation

### Workaround Options
1. Find correct protobuf generation command
2. Use build tags to conditionally compile
3. Implement without protobuf changes initially

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `config/legacy_detection.go`
- `config/legacy_detection_windows.go`
- `config/legacy_detection_unix.go`
- `PHASE3_BRANDING_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`

### Modified:
- `config/proto/config.proto` - Added use_legacy_branding field
- `config/branding.go` - Updated to use config object

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Fix Protobuf Generation
1. Find correct protoc command
2. Set up proper import paths
3. Regenerate config.pb.go
4. Continue with integration

### Option 2: Alternative Implementation
1. Use environment variable for legacy mode
2. Add command line flag
3. Store in separate config file
4. Bypass protobuf for now

### Option 3: Simpler Approach
1. Start with hardcoded detection
2. Update service names manually
3. Add configuration later
4. Focus on getting working prototype

## Recommendation

Given the protobuf generation blocker, I recommend:
1. **Temporarily bypass** the protobuf configuration
2. **Implement branding** using the existing system
3. **Focus on updating** the actual usage points
4. **Return to protobuf** integration later

This allows progress while avoiding the build system complexity.

## Code Status
- Compilation currently fails due to missing protobuf fields
- Legacy detection code is complete and ready
- Branding system is designed but not integrated

## Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: All changes are additive
- **No breaking changes**: Legacy detection ensures compatibility
- **Easy rollback**: Can revert to previous commits

The branding system architecture is sound, we just need to resolve the protobuf generation issue or work around it.
